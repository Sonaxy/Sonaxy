Hello,

My name is Sonaxy Mohanty. Currently I'm pursuing a master's degree in Data Science and Analytics from The University of Oklahoma, Norman and expecting to graduate in MAy 2023. After completing my Undergrad in Electronics and Communication Engineering (2014) from Siksha O' Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar, India, I had a 6 years of Analytics experience in SQL, P/L SQL, Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence technologies with ETL and Reporting while working with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) from 2014-2020. Hence, here I am doing my Master's to further build upon my knowledge in the data field, learning and applying data science tools.

In my free time I love to read, watch movies, garden.
