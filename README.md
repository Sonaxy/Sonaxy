Hello,
My name is Sonaxy Mohanty. 

As a skilled Data Scientist, I have a strong background in Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing with experience in ML model development. I specialize in Regression Models, Time Series Forecasting, Clustering, Decision Trees, Bagging and Boosting algorithms, and more. With over 7 years of experience, I am skilled in Python, R, SQL, Microsoft Power BI and Tableau, equipped with data wrangling techniques, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis.

With a solid background of over 6 years of experience in the Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence field, I have developed expertise in SQL, PL/SQL, ETL, and Reporting, successfully managing end-to-end project delivery for diverse clients using both Agile and Waterfall methodologies. My skills also include implementing and configuring solutions, data modeling, and report development, allowing me to effectively solve complex business challenges.

To stay ahead of the curve, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Data Science and Analytics to further enhance my skills in Machine Learning, R, and Python. This academic pursuit has also honed my abilities in comprehending data science issues, data wrangling techniques, predictive and statistical modeling, and model evaluations that are critical in decision-making. I have spent nearly 2 years working on data science problems in healthcare, energy, and finance domains, utilizing R and Python, and I am expected to graduate in May 2023.

As a highly motivated individual, I am actively seeking a Data Scientist role that will allow me to apply my skills and experience to real-world problems. My previous work experience and academic training have sharpened my problem-solving and teamwork abilities, with a strong focus on detail and precision. I firmly believe that attaining organizational and personal objectives are interrelated, and I am eager to contribute my expertise to drive meaningful impact in any organization I work with.

In my free time I love to read, watch movies, garden.
