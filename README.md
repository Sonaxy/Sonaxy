Hello,
My name is Sonaxy Mohanty. 

With over 7 years of experience in the Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence field, I have honed my skills in SQL, PL/SQL, ETL, and Reporting. I have worked with a diverse range of clients, managing every stage of the Software Development Life Cycle, from initial business requirement gathering to successful project delivery, both for Agile and Waterfall methodologies. 

To stay ahead of the curve, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Data Science and Analytics, which will further my knowledge of Machine Learning, R, and Python, and help me chart an exciting career path in this domain. I have honed my abilities in comprehending data science issues, data wrangling techniques, predictive and statistical modeling, and model evaluations that are critical in decision-making. I have spent almost 2 years working on data science problems for healthcare, energy, and finance domains, utilizing R and Python. I am expected to graduate in May 2023.

I am keenly interested in securing a Data Scientist role that will allow me to apply my skills and experience to real-world problems. My previous work experience and academic training have sharpened my problem-solving and teamwork abilities, with a strong focus on detail and precision. I believe that attaining organizational and personal objectives are interrelated.

In my free time I love to read, watch movies, garden.
